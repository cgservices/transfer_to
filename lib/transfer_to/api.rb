    #
    # parameters
    # ==========
    # msisdn
    # ------
    # The international phone number of the user requesting to credit
    # a TransferToAPI phone number. The format must contain the country code,
    # and will be valid with or without the ‘+’ or ‘00’ placed before it. For
    # example: “6012345678” or “+6012345678” or “006012345678” (Malaysia) are
    # all valid.
    #
    # product
    # -------
    # This field is used to define the remote product(often, the same as the
    # amount in destination currency) to use in the request.
    #
    # destination
    # -----------
    # This is the destination phone number that will be credited with the
    # amount transferred. Format is similar to “msisdn”.
    #
    # operator_id
    # -----------
    # It defines the operator id of the destination MSISDN that must be used
    # when treating the request. If set, the platform will be forced to use
    # this operatorID and will not identify the operator of the destination
    # MSISDN based on the numbering plan. It must be very useful in case of
    # countries with number portability if you are able to know the destination
    # operator.
    #
    # simulate
    # ----------
    # Default: false
    # sends the topup request without doing the actual topup.
